    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue our journey on exploring interpretability of complex models in AI, today we will look at another method to analyze machine learning model named SHAP. SHAP, short for Shapley Additive Explanations, aims to unify approaches before it, such as LIME, DeepLIFT. SHAP has a solid theoretical foundation and practical effectiveness since the indicator is based on Shapley value from cooperative game theory. It helps to explain the output of any machine learning model by attributing to each feature the change in the expected model prediction when we condition of that feature, given that these attributions are distributed fairly among the features. In other words, Shapley value is the marginal contribution of a feature into the model's final prediction. So it is an indicator of importance for that feature. In cooperative game theory, players can join into coalition and gets certain payoff from being in coalition. Applied into machine learning, each feature is a player and feature combinations are coalitions. For each feature in interest, we consider all the possible coalitions, then we calculate the contribution of that feature in each of those coalitions, by calculating the resulted difference in output when keeping it in and then leaving it out of the model. Then we take the average of those contributions to have the Shapley value for that feature. The upsides of SHAP are its unified nature and fairness. It can be used for linear models and deep learning models. It avoid certain biases in other techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shapley value\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a toy example, a model to predict house price based on the area, address, house age, and whether it has a park nearby. The predicted price for a house of 50m2 near the center, newly built and not having a park nearby can be 200,000, 50,000 different from the average prediction by the model. Now we can ask the question, how much each of those features contributed to the prediction? It could be that the area of 50m2 contributed to -10,000 in the 50,000 difference, the addrress contributed to 40,000 in the difference, the house age contributed 20,000 and the having park nearby feature contributed 0. First, to calculate the contribution of the area of the house, we need to list out all the possible coalitions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- No features\n",
    "- Address\n",
    "- Address + House age\n",
    "- Address + Park-nearby\n",
    "- House age + Park-nearby\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these combinations we compute the predicted apartment price with and without the area feature and take the difference. Then we take the weighted average of those marginal contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For image processing tasks, a player can be a super pixel (i.e. a group of pixels that are close and similar to each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "# SHAP\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the SHAP equation for additive feature attribution methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g(z) = \\phi_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^M \\phi_j z_j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where g is the approximation model, M is the maximum coalition size, $$ \\phi_j \\in R $$ is the feature attribution for feature j (i.e. the Shapley value). \n",
    "\n",
    "Addtive feature attribution methods like LIME, DeepLIFT above have very desirable properties: local accuracy, missingness, and consistency. The first property is local accuracy which requires the explanation model to at least match the output of the complex model for the neighbourhood of that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = g(x') = \\phi_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^M \\phi_i x_i' $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The explanation model would match the original model when we sample around the point x. The second property is missingness. Missing features in the original input will have no attributed impact. In other words, those features won't receive any attribution from the final outcome. The third property is consistency, when some input's contribution increases or stays the same, that input's attribution will not decrease.\n",
