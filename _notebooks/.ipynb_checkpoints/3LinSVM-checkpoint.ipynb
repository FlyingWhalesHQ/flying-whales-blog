    "Linear Support Vector Machine is the problem that it find a separating line for data points (hence classification). There are 2 classes hence we use a sign function with a hinge loss.

A sign function is named so since it outputs the sign of the value of the linear combination:\n",

For the whole training dataset, we simply take average of those smaller loss functions. There are two more concepts that we need to know: the score and the margin. The score is $$ \\theta \\cdot x $$ and it is how confident we are in predicting the positive class. The margin is $$ (\\theta \\cdot x)y = \\hat{y} y $$ and it shows how correct we are. Since the margin takes into account the largeness of prediction and true value, we use it as the loss function instead of the not-equal comparison. Actually they are equivalent:\n",
