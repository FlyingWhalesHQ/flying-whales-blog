    "Thinking about our usual problem: given a feature vector and an output vector, naive Bayes classifiers would help us to classify a new input instance into one of the classes in the output vector. Naive Bayes classification makes use of Bayes’ theorem and some simple assumptions. Here is the Bayes’ theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A)}{P(A)P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English, $$ P(A\\mid B) $$ is the probability of A given B. $$ P(B \\mid A) $$ is the probability of B given A. P(A), P(B) are the probabilities of A and B respectively. This theorem simply states that posterior probability of an event A given B ($$ P(A \\mid B) $$ ) would equal the prior probability of that event (P(A)) multiply with the likelihood of that event ($$ P(B \\mid A) $$ which can also be explained as the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis that event A is true) divided by the evidence (P(B)). The smart and useful thing about this theorem is that it incorporates prior knowledge for you into your prediction, which in some cases, makes very educated guesses. One of the applications of Bayesian inference in the real world as of today is to classify documents (mainly). Another is on inferring whose DNA using biology knowledge (which sparks fundamental questions on ethics and privacy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s come back to the model and speak about the other component of naive Bayes: the two naive assumptions. First, we assume that the input x are conditionally independent from each other and second, that each input feature contributes equally to y the class prediction. These assumptions, despite being simple, work quite well in reality. To proceed, let's make use of some math symbol manipulations. How do those above assumptions translate into math notation? We first need to formulate the problem using mathematical symbols: Let X be the input vector, y be the prediction using X, into K classes. When we want to get the probability of y given those X, we use Bayes’ theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(y|X) = \\frac{P(X|y) P(y)}{P(X)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing the naive assumptions:\n",
    "\t\n",
    "$$ P(y|x1, x2,..., xn) = \\frac{P(x_{1}|y) P(x_{2}|y) ...P(x_{n}|y)}{P(x_{1}) P (x_{2})...P(x_{n})P(y)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the denominator is constant, we remove it and use proportionality instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(y \\mid x_{1}, x_{2},..., x_{n}) P(x_{1} \\mid y) P(x_{2}\\mid y) ...P(x_{n}\\mid y) P(y)=P(y)\\prod_{i=1}{n}P(x_{i}\\mid y) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "# Maximum likelihood <a name=\"maxili\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the usual maximum likelihood principle: assume the highest probability that makes all the training y happens (that would give the prediction for the most possible class, too):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k = arg max_{k} P(y \\mid X) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the transformation in the previous section:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k = arg max_{k} P(y) \\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(x_{i} \\mid y) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, the calculation of y obviously depends on the type of distributions of $$ P(x_{i} \\mid y) $$. Different classifiers are different in the way they make different assumptions on that distribution type. There are three main types: Gaussian naive Bayes, multinomial naive Bayes, and Bernoulli naive Bayes. With a given dataset, the posterior probabilities can be calculated from the data and then used as labels for a typical supervised learning problem using naive Bayes algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Gaussian naive Bayes <a name=\"gnb\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we assume the conditional probability to be normally distributed, we make use of the following characteristics of that distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean $$ \\mu = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}{n}x_{i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation $$ \\sigma =\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}{n}(x_{i}- \\mu )^{2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Density function $$ p(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\sigma}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Consider a small dataset with two features: precipitation (rain level) and holiday, output: traffic or not. The precipitation level is 86 96 80 65 70 80 90 75 for days of traffic jams and 85 90 70 95 91 for days of traffic ok. Using two different set of rain levels (for two different types of traffic), we can calculate the mean and standard deviation for these two classes of prediction. Then we use those two different mean and standard deviation for the calculation of probability. That said, the probability of traffic jam with rain level of 74 would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(rain = 74 | jam = yes) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\sigma}e^{-\\frac{(74-\\mu)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}}= 0.0344 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of traffic ok with rain level 74 would be (this time with different mean and standard deviation):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(rain = 74 | jam = no) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\sigma}e^{-\\frac{(74-\\mu)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}}= 0.0187 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we need to normalize those predictions before using it in production: calculate all possible probabilities, sum them up and then divide each for the total to get the real probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: A credit institution decides whether to lend a credit line to a person based on several factors: age, income, student status, credit rate. In this case, let scale the income so that it comes from range 0 to 10. We encode the categorical attribute \"student-or-not\" into 0 and 1 with 0 being negative. Same for \"lend-or-not\" target. Credit rate also comes from 0 to 10.\n",
