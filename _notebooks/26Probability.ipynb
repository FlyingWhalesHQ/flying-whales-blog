    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events and the likelihood of their occurrence. It is used to model situations where there is uncertainty or randomness involved, and is widely applied in various fields such as statistics, finance, physics, engineering, and computer science. Probability is also widely used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where it is used to model uncertainty in data and to make predictions.\n",

    "# Random variable\n",
    "\n",
    "A randome variable x denotes an uncertain quantity. It may be the result of a coin flip or the measurement of temperature. Each time we experience x, it can take a different value $$ x_i $$. However, values can repeat themselves and some seems to appear more frequent than others. This information is captured by the probability distribution $$ Pr(x) $$ of the random variable x. Note that a random variable x can assign number to each outcome. For example, in the die experiment we can assign to the six outcomes i the numbers 10i: $$ x(1) = 10, x(2) = 20.. x(6) = 60 $$ or we can assign number 1 to even outcomes and number zero to odd outcomes: $$ x(1) = x(3) = x(5) = 0, x(2) = x(4) = x(6) = 1 $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also say, in some other words: if the experiment is done n times and the event A occurs $$ n_A $$ times, then with a high degree of certainty, the relative frequency $$ \\frac{n_A}{n} $$ of the occurrence of A is close to P(A): $$ P(A) \\approx \\frac{n_A}{n} $$ provided that n is sufficiently large. In the limit, theoretically, the probability P(A) of event A can be described as a hypothesis $$ P(A) = lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{n_A}{n} $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random variable can become a function f(x) when the domain is the set of all experiment outcomes (so that the total proabilities summed to one). Note that a function is a rule of correspondence between x and y, with the values of the independent variable x form a set D named the domain and the values of dependent y = f(x) form the range set R of the function. In another way, we have two sets of number D and R. For every x in D we assign a number y = f(x) belong to R. We would say f is the function of x. The mapping between x and y can be one to one or many to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of random variables: discrete and continuous. A discrete variable has a set of values. This set can be an ordered set, for example the list of a dice rolling values, ranging from 1 to 6, or it can be an unordered one, say, the weather outcomes of sunny, snowy, rainy and windy. It can be finite or infinite and the probability distribution is best shown as a histogram. With that, each possible outcome has a positive probability and the sum of all such probability is 1. On the other hand, continuous random variable has values in the real domain. These can also be finite or infinite, depending on the problem. It can be infinite but bounded and the probability distribution is best shown as the graph of the probability density function (pdf). Each outcome would have its own probability (propensity) and the integral of the pdf always be 1, similar to the discrete variable.\n",
