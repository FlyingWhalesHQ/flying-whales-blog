    "$$ 1[...] $$ is a function such that if the inside statement is true, it returns value 1, if false, it returns 0. For the whole training dataset, we simply take average of those smaller loss functions. There are two more concepts that we need to know: the score and the margin. The score is $$ \\theta \\cdot x $$ and it is how confident we are in predicting the positive class. The margin is $$ (\\theta \\cdot x)y = \\hat{y} y $$ and it shows how correct we are. Since the margin takes into account the largeness of prediction and true value, we use it as the loss function instead of the not-equal comparison. Actually they are equivalent:\n",

    "Now we can plot the loss function, for all margin values that are negative, the loss is 1. For all margin values that are non negative, the loss is 0. Remember that the total loss of the whole training set is the average of all the loss zero-one function for each data point, hence the gradient of the total loss depends on the total gradient of all smaller loss functions, apart from the scalar of dividing by the size of the training set (for averaging calculation). Here is the total of smaller gradients:\n",

But in hinge loss, we don't just use the margin, we use $$ 1 - margin $$, so we aim for some positive margin even when we already predict correctly. That changes the loss a bit fundamentally.\n",
