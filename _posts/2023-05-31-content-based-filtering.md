# Introduction

Content based filtering is a technique used in recommendation system that is based on the content (representing by features) of the items.

Let's start with the utility matrix: the columns being the users and the rows being the items. Since each user rates only a few items, the matrix is sparse, i.e. there are many missing values. If we can fill in those missing values, we can roughly know which items the user like and maybe suggest them those items. If we can classify the items into groups, when new item comes in the classification algorithm would predict the class the item belongs to and can also provide recommendation for the users accordingly.

For the rating, it can be explicit rating in which the user rates the items according to their preference or it can be implicit rating in which the user's preference is extrapolated based on the number of times they rewatch the videos, the amount of time they visit the product, or when the user actually buys that item.

# Content based recommendation

To build a content based recommendation system, we need to build a profile for each items. A profile is represented by a feature vector. For example, the features of a movie can be the actor, the director, the year and the genre.

# Code examples

Using the MovieLens dataset, we are going to do three examples: recommend movies based on genres, tags and ratings. When we recommend based on genres, it is the content of the movies that we care about. So if we want a movie for children, it is safer to use this method since it only recommends movies in proximity of the children genre. When we recommend based on tags, it is the comment of the users that we care about. And it is not just one user's comment, we aggregate the comments from different users on the same movies and generate new recommendation based on that. Doing this makes use of the preference of the user base. Surely some user might care about what other people say about the product and base their decision on that. When we recommend based on ratings, it is similar, this is for users who care about the opinion of the crowd to pick their next movie to watch. At the end, we can aggregate those three models and have a long list of recommendations minus the duplicates.

The techniques used are called TF-IDF and CountVectorizer. TF-IDF has been introduced in LSD/LSA articles. CountVectorizer in Python simply counts the number of appearance of the word in the documents, those are indicators of similarity.

Apart from the genres, we also have the information about the movie's tags by user. This kind of information reveals a bit more about the preference of users on a movie.

In conclusion, content based filtering is a very popular method in building recommendation system. And we have reasonably good results. There are some flaws, though. When we ask to recommend by tags, the algorithm recommends "Pulp Fiction" for "Toy Story". This is a bit too much if we are talking about children customer. In the algorithm to recommend by ratings, it is normal to have a wide range of genres recommended and this is what the user might need. They might just need a 5 star movie, doesn't matter the topics. But for the algorithm that recommends based on users' tags, Toy Story and Pulp Fiction are still widely inappropriate in the case of children, even though it is not in the top 5 recommendations. The algorithm might just reveals some bias in the preference of the user, and it is not pretty.

In the next example, we get access to the genome scores of the tags of the movie lists. The genome score measures how relevant a tag is to a movie, and there is a tag list of a thousand. These tag scores have been calculated in advance by a machine learning algorithm, based on tags, ratings, and textual reviews. This genome score table provides a better overview of the movie's content for the machine to grasp. Then we can calculate the cosine similarities of those tag score vectors and use them for recommendation. The result is much better than before, since asking for recommendations on Toy Story returns very similar movies in the genres for children: Shrek, Ice Age, Monster Inc, Finding Nemo, Rattatouile, Up.

genome_tags = pd.read_csv('ml-latest-small/genome_tags.csv')

If we have access to lengthy overview or critics of the movies, or if the items are documents, we can leverage NLP techniques to process and analyze the documents then calculate the cosine similarity. This algorithm can be used to suggest title for blog posts, or suggest new movies to watch.

Let's try to use three movie plots. NLP's preprocessing task involves lowercasing, removing punctuations, removing stopwords, lemmatizing etc. Here we would skip this step. We would use the Word2Vec model (which comes with its latent word space) to train further on this new corpus of three plots. The number of dimensions for each word is 100. We consider a window of 10 words for each word. Word occurring less than five times would be ignored. Then we process the three plots. Each plot would have their own number of words. Each of these words are represented as a Word2Vec vector (100 dimensional vector). Each vector would then be averaged. So that we have a resulting list of three plots, each consists of 100 numerically represented words. Then we calculate the cosine similarity among those plots.

From the result, we can see that these three movies are not similar with similarity indices from 0.1 to 0.2. All those movies are in 2020: Demon Slayer (Japanese and anime based), the Eight Hundred (Chinese war drama), Bad Boys for Life (American action comedy). We can see that these movies come from very different cultures.


```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

with open('movies/movie1.txt', 'r') as f:
    m1 = f.read()
with open('movies/movie2.txt', 'r') as f:
    m2 = f.read()
with open('movies/movie3.txt', 'r') as f:
    m3 = f.read()

```
