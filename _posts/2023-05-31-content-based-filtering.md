# Introduction

Content based filtering is a technique used in recommendation system that is based on the content of items, i.e. the features (that can be hidden).

Let's start with the utility matrix: with the columns being the users and the rows being the items. Since each user rates only a few items, the matrix is sparse, i.e. there are many missing values. If we can fill in those missing values, we can roughly know which items the user like and maybe suggest them those items. If we can classify the items into groups, when new item comes in the classification algorithm would predict the class the item belongs to and can also provide recommendation for the users accordingly.

For the rating, it can be explicit rating in which the user rates the items according to their preference or it can be implicit rating in which the user's preference is extrapolated based on the number of times they rewatch the videos, the amount of time they visit the product, or when the user actually buys that item.

# Content based recommendation

To build a content based recommendation system, we need to profile all the items. A profile is represented by a feature vector. For example, the features of a song can be the singer, the author, the year and the genre.

# Code examples

Using the MovieLens dataset, we are going to do three examples: recommend movies based on genres, tags and ratings. When we recommend based on genres, it is the content of the movies that we care about. So if we want a movie for children, it is safer to use this method since it only recommends movies in proximity of the children genre. When we recommend based on tags, it is the comment of the users that we care about. And it is not just one user's comment, we aggregate the comments from different users on the same movies and generate new recommendation based on that. Doing this makes use of the preference of the user base. Surely some user might care about what other people say about the product and base their decision on that. When we recommend based on ratings, it is similar, this is for users who care about the opinion of the crowd to pick their next movie to watch. At the end, we can aggregate those three models and have a long list of recommendations minus the duplicates.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, content based filtering is a very popular method in building recommendation system. And we have reasonably good results. There are some flaws, though. When we ask to recommend by tags, the algorithm recommends "Pulp Fiction" for "Toy Story". This is a bit too much if we are talking about children customer. In the algorithm to recommend by ratings, it is normal to have a wide range of genres recommended and this is what the user might need. They might just need a 5 star movie, doesn't matter the topics. But for the algorithm that recommends based on users' tags, Toy Story and Pulp Fiction are still widely inappropriate in the case of children, even though it is not in the top 5 recommendations. The algorithm might just reveals some bias in the preference of the user, and it is not pretty.
